## General info

This project is part of Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career pathway.

I was required to use my existing knowledge of JavaScript to build the logic for the game, incorporating ES6 class syntax and methods.

This project introduced me to working with user input in Node.js.

## Setup

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine.

In your terminal, navigate to your  newly-created project folder and run `node main.js` to launch the game.

To quit the game at any point, press CTRL + C.

Follow the instructions on the screen to navigate through the field. To move, type `l`, `r`, `u` or `d` and hit enter.

If you fall in a hole, you will lose and the game will automatically quit. To play again, run the `node main.js` command again in your terminal.
